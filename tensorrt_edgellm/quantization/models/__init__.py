"""Standalone model implementations for quantization.

Some model architectures used by TensorRT Edge-LLM (e.g. EAGLE3 draft
models for speculative decoding) are not available in HuggingFace
``transformers`` and cannot be loaded via ``AutoModel``.  This package
provides minimal PyTorch re-implementations of those models — just
enough to run ModelOpt quantization and export a unified checkpoint.
