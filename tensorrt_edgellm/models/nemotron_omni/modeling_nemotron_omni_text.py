Nemotron-Omni LLM backbone.

The Nemotron-Omni LLM is the NemotronH hybrid decoder (Mamba2 + Attention +
MoE). Its implementation lives in ``models/nemotron_h/`` and is dispatched by
the default ``AutoModel`` pipeline from ``llm_config.architectures =
["NemotronHForCausalLM"]`` in the HF checkpoint's ``config.json``.

This module re-exports it under the Nemotron-Omni namespace so all three
components (LLM, visual, audio) are exported together by
:mod:`tensorrt_edgellm.scripts.export` when the checkpoint lives in one HF repo.

For export:
    from tensorrt_edgellm.model import AutoModel
    from tensorrt_edgellm.onnx.export import export_onnx
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_dir)
    export_onnx(model, output_path, model_dir=model_dir)
"""
from ..nemotron_h.modeling_nemotron_h import \
    NemotronHCausalLM as NemotronOmniLanguageModel

__all__ = ["NemotronOmniLanguageModel"]
