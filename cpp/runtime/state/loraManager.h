//! Manages LoRA adapter weights and switching.
//!
//! Maintains a map of named adapters, each containing a set of weight tensors
//! identified by binding name.  At any time at most one adapter is "active".
//! Switching adapters is O(1) — no GPU copies are required because the
//! TensorRT engine binds directly to the stored tensor pointers.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   1. `loadWeights()` or `addWeights()` to register adapter(s).
//!   2. `switchWeights(name)` to activate an adapter.
//!   3. `getActiveWeight(bindingName)` to retrieve the tensor for engine binding.
//!   4. `resetWeights()` to deactivate (bind dummy zero-tensors).
